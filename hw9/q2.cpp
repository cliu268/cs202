// Q2: Euler Circuit https://xjoi.net/contest/4064
/*
Give a directed graph to determine if there is an Euler circuit

Input :
The first line is a positive integer n, m, which represents the number of points and the number of sides.
Next m lines, each line contains two positive integers x, y ,to indicate that there is a directed edge from x to y.

Output :
The output is only one line, "Yes" means presence, and "No" means no.

Sample input:
5 9
1 2
3 1
4 2
3 4
2 2
5 4
2 5
2 3
4 3

Sample output:
Yes
