/*
Description:
There are n students in class. Some of them are friends, and some of them are not. Friendship has transitivity. 
For example, if A is B's friend, and B is C's friend, and A will be C's friend as a result of transitivity. 
So-called social circle, means a set of people who are all friends to each other. Note that there could be multiple social circles.
Given a n by n matrix M, representing the friendships in class. If M[i][j] = 1, i-th student and j-th student are friends to 
each other; otherwise their relationship is unknown (with transitivity students could be friends even they are not friends directly). 
Please compute the number of social circles in total.

Input:
