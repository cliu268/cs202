/*
Time limit:1s  Memory limit:128M
Description:
Given n distinct unordered letter pairs (case sensitive. Unordered means letters in pairs can change their position), 
please find a string whose length is n+1, such that each letter pair appears in this string.

Input:
The first line contains a positive integer n. 
The next n lines each contains two letters, which means those two letters should be adjacent. 

Output:
Output the string that satisfies the condition.
If there is no such strin, outputâ€œNo Solution".
If there is more than one solution, please output the solution whose front letter's lexicographic order is the smallest.

Sample input 1:
4
aZ
tZ
Xt
aX

Sample output 2:
XaZtX

Note: The number of distinct unordered letter pairs is limited. The size of n can be calculated.
